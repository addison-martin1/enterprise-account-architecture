# Enterprise account architecture
{: #about}

Large enterprises that allow an account structure, cross account networking, resource deployment, and billing to develop organically run the risk of encountering governance, scaling, security, and accounting issues. This document provides a recommendation for how to address these concerns across accounts so that a robust, compliant, and scalable solution can be achieved.

This recommendation extends and compliments the account and resource level guidance that is found in the [IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-about) and other IBM Cloud best practices such as:
